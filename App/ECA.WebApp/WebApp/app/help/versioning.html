    Each plan is given a version number that consists of a major and a minor version.<br />
    The version number is written as <i>major</i>.<i>minor</i> such as version 1.2.
</p>
<p>
    The following describes the concepts and rules associated with plan versioning.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            When a plan is initially imported, it is assigned a version number of 0.1.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            When a plan is checked out, the plan is copied and the minor version number is incremented.<br />
            For example, if the current version is 0.1, then the plan is copied to version 0.2 after it is checked out.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            This new minor version can be deleted using the <i>Delete Version</i> action.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Only the latest version of a plan can be checked out or submitted for approval.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Once a plan is approved and published, it is promoted to the next major version number.<br />
            For example, if version 0.2 is approved and published, it is promoted to version 1.0.<br />
            <b>Every published plan has a minor version number of zero.</b>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            A previously published plan that has been unpublished, can be republished with the same version number.<br />
            Essentially, this is to republish a plan that was inadvertently unpublished.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Only the highest published version number is shown to guests on the home page.<br />
        <b>It is therefore not necessary to unpublish a plan before publishing an update.</b>
    </li>
</ul>
