<p>
    Plans start off as being imported from an external system and end up as
    published plans that are viewable by all guests. This Manage Plans page
    is what helps you move a plan through the system.
</p>
<p>
    At a high level, you check out a plan, edit it until it looks good, check
    it back in, and then submit it for approval. An approver can then publish
    or reject the plan. The table below is a more detailed description of each
    status and the actions that can be performed for that status.

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        After one hour of no modifications, any standard user can check in a plan. The owner's edits are saved. The next user can then check out the plan again under their name.
    </li>
    <li>
        Checking out a published plan simply means that the plan is being updated before publishing a revised version.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Please note that only those buttons representing valid and authorized user actions are shown when viewing a plan.
