<!--
Sample Plan XML Import Template
===============================

Notes:

1. The mission code element is REQUIRED and the mission must already exist
   in the database. Consider importing all missions before importing plans.

2. The country code element is optional. If it is not specified, then the
   primary country code for the mission is used. In the case of VIENNA,
   this would most likely be Austria, but it is not always the case.
   If a mission supports multiple countries, then an alternate country code
   can be specified.

3. The fiscal year is REQUIRED. There can only be one plan for each
   mission-country-year combination. This means than an embassy can
   have multiple plans in a given year, as long as each plan is for
   a different country.

4. Processing Instructions

4.1 The <?import replace?> processing instruction is useful for testing
    if you want to reimport the same plan multiple times. It should be
    removed when creating actual files for production use.

4.2 The <?import ignore?> processing instruction only replaces plans that
    have an Imported status (i.e., they have not been modified). Any plan
    in the XML document that matches an edited plan is ignored.

5. Finally, multiple plans can be enclosed in a <Plans> tag at the
   beginning of the file and a <Plans> closing tag at the end of the
   file. The <?import replace?> directive need only be specified once
   before the opening <Plans> tag when testing bulk imports.
